## The DyIO and Processing ##

How do you use the DyIO with processing? Easy! After Installing BowlerStudio (to get drivers) just drag the NRSDK jar located  *KEVIN, PUT LOCATION OF NRSDK JAR HERE* into your processing sketch to install the library.

You'll need to connect to your DyIO using the `Connection Dialouge` or `Serial Connection`
